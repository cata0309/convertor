-> what is the sum of the division of three by seven and the product of three
divided by seven and four plus three = 5.142857
-> what is the sum of the division of three by seven and the product of three
divided by seven and ( four plus three ) = 3.428571
-> 4+-3/-54 = 4.055556
-> one + one = 2.000000
-> ( one + 32/-3 ) / -6 = 1.611111
-> how much is one divided by 0.00032 = 3125.000000
-> one divided by -4.5 = -0.222222
-> sum of one plus one and three = 5.000000
-> sum of ( one plus one ) and three = 5.000000
-> division of ( three ) by ten = 0.300000
-> what is the sum of the division of three by seven and the product of three
by five=15.428571429
-> one + minus three = -2.00000
